This diagram gives stakeholders an “aha!” moment as, for the first time, they have a picture of the duties employees or customers accomplish in their work lives. Through the use of a Consolidated Workflow Diagram, we see how a user moves through tasks and we extrapolate from here to the various cognitive states a user inhabits while engaged with the solution or process. These cognitive states represent a model of what is in people’s minds as they do their work: their mental model. This understanding has implications for both design and marketing.

As the customer interacts with the company or engages in a life process, such as buying a house, understanding the key activities and experiences the customer has helps determine the most valuable places to focus resources. This ensures that each interaction with the company fits the experience the organization wants to provide. The understanding of the key activities and experiences is built into an informative diagram called a Customer Journey Map. This diagram informs key decisions for business, marketing and design executives, and can shift stakeholders’ thinking about where to engage across the lifecycle of a customer’s journey.
