                        WDS was contracted to do UX consulting work for at the time the largest healthcare portal website called Pfizer for Professionals or PFP.

                        The CMS System that won the Pfizer bid was a custom Documentum solution, built by a company in Ohio. The software was called SiteBuilder and was the CMS solution for a team of developers. WDS observed the developers struggling with this CMS platform. We started interviewing the developers and found out the system was extremely buggy. Working on the system we first hand observed the system crashing during check ins, pushes and builds. The system rarely gave meaningful error messages and many times developers sat there for hours watching a spinning icon. Many times only partial changes made up to the server and there was no consistency to the errors. What worked one day didn't mean it word work the next. The developers strategically created workarounds for the most basic tasks. Customer support was extremely poor.</p>

                        WDS started to understand this was a major issue for Pfizer that affected and slowed updates to the website. WDS began documenting lost man hours and overtime costs associated with developers waiting on the CMS system. We knew it was important so we conducted interviews with stakeholders. We wanted to understand the decision making process and get our hands on the contract pfizer had with the vendor.

                        WDS presented our findings to the CTO and many c-suite managers. WDS was questioned heavily on why this meeting was needed and who authorized it. Our team explained that we saw a problem that needed to be solved and this is what out business does. We presented to them the daily workflow of a developer working on their CMS system. The frustration and lost time involved with the simplest of tasks. We just focused on two developers in the Philly office. We proved that on average the developers wasted 28% of their time due to the buggy nature of the application. Also we found that the company only delivered on half the features that were contractual promised.</p>

                        After presenting the issues WDS, Pfizer requested us to find some CMS alternatives for pfizer and the team. Two weeks later we presented three alternatives with the pros and cons of each. Pfizer choose the Microsoft solution.   </p>

                        Interesting Story - WDS was overseeing the transition from one CMS system to another. Another consulating firm was hired to refactor all the files and prepare for the move to the sharepoint environment. The consulting firm contacting WDS to get advice on promoting CSS changes on Sitebuilder. WDS and the development team learned our lesson and gave up on making changes to the CSS file and made all changes CSS changes in-line. WDS advised them against promoting CSS changes through sitebuider environment because the system to seems verify everyone of the 25,000 files. The last time the changes took over 8 hours to complete. Considering that was at the start of the project we added 3 more hours and told them 11 hours to promote the file.</p>
                        <p className="content-text-18">
                         11 hours sounds crazy, but the sitebuilder environemnt was insane. We knew this for months and was just the start of Pfizer managers and outside vendors to experience our pain. Of course everyone in the meeting just about laughed at us and treated us like we were clueless. But it was the insanity of the program and not our logic. The managers and vendor talked and said it could be completed in under 2 hours. The push would begin at 6pm and end at 8pm. At 4am WDS receives a phone call that begins "we will never doubt you again, could you tell us how to force this file onto the server. Its been 10 hours and we don't know if we are any closer than we were during the first hour". We explained they needed to contact the server hosting company in NJ and have them directly place the file on the server. We instructed them to go there in person to ensure it will be completed by the start of business. The company bought us and the team breakfast all week. Even though they didn't believe us, they kept a team on call just in case and it saved them.</p>

                        Pfizer quickly froze the project. Needing to refactor 27,000 files from .jsp to .asp an outside vendor was brought in to help with the transition. Pfizer estimates that WDS saved them close to 250,000 by bringing to light the unseen problems.
