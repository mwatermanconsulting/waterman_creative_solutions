                        WDS was contracted for UX consulting and development work for the largest healthcare portal named Pfizer for Professionals, or PFP. At launch the site consisted of 1400 pages. The website needed to be organized and simplified for the doctors. The contract lasted for almost 40 months.</p>

                        The WDS method of uncovering business problems is through observation. One day working on the PFP project, WDS observed the developers struggling with the CMS platform provided by Pfizer. Pfizer required every vendor to use the CMS System. The CMS platform was a custom Documentum solution, built by a company in Ohio. The CMS platform was named SiteBuilder. </p>
                        <p className="content-text-18"> 
                         WDS started interviewing the developers and discovered the system was extremely buggy. Working on the system, they found the system crashing during check ins, pushes and builds. The system rarely gave meaningful error messages and many times developers sat there for hours watching a spinning icon, wondering if the application crashed or was processing. Stopping the process while it was processing increased chances that all work would be lost. They observed times when only partial changes made up to the server and there was no consistency to the errors. What worked one day didn't work the next. The developers strategically created workarounds for the most basic tasks. Customer support was extremely poor.</p>

                        WDS started to understand scale of the problem with the current CMS system and began documenting issues, including lost man hours and overtime costs associated with the developers waiting on the CMS system. They researched the documentation, contracts and emails and uncovered breaches in the contract caused by missing and broken features promised in the contract. Pfizer was unaware of the issues and WDS wanted to make a strong case against this CMS system.

                        WDS presented findings to the CTO and many C-suite managers. WDS was questioned heavily on why this meeting was needed and who authorized it. Their team explained that they saw a problem that needed to be solved and this is what their business does, uncovering design and business problems. They described  the developer journey and  work flows, the frustration they experienced everyday and the lost time involved with the simplest of tasks. They focused on two developers in the Philly office. WDS presented that on average the developers wasted 28% of their time due to the buggy nature of the application. Also it was found that the vendor only delivered half the features that were contractually promised.</p>

                        After presenting the CMS issues, Pfizer requested that WDS find some CMS alternatives. Three alternatives were presented and Pfizer chose a Microsoft solution, Sharepoint. </p>
                        <p className="content-text-18">
                         Another consulting firm was hired to refactor all files and prepare them for the move to the Sharepoint environment. This involved migrating all the HTML files from .jsp to .asp. The consulting firm contacted WDS to get advice on promoting CSS changes on Sitebuilder. WDS had learned from experience not to touch the CSS file, and instead used  workarounds for styling by making all CSS changes in-line. They advised them against promoting CSS changes through Sitebuider environment because the system will verify every file and currently there was over 2,000 of them. The last time it was done the changes took over 5 hours to complete. Considering that was at the start of the project, they were told that between 8-11 hours were needed to promote the file.</p>
                        <p className="content-text-18">
                         WDS's advice was ignored, saying it is crazy that it would take 8-11 hours to promote one file even though they were told how unstable the sitebuilder environment was with CSS files. The managers and vendor left confident that it could be completed in under 2 hours. The plan was to push the CSS changes at 6pm and end at 8pm. At 4am WDS received a phone call that began with "we will never doubt you again, could you tell us how to force this file onto the server. Its been 10 hours and we don't know if we are any closer than we were during the first hour." WDS explained that they needed to contact the hosting company in NJ and have them directly place the file on the server by going there in person to ensure it will be completed by the start of business. The company bought WDS and the team breakfast all week. </p>
