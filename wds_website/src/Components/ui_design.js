                            Known as low-tech, this is a simple and easy translation of the product and design concepts. It’s used to turn the design ideas into testable and tangible artifacts, collecting and analyzing the user demands at the early stage.

                            The low-fidelity prototype focuses on function, structure, process, and provide the most simple framework and elements. In the early stages of product design, it can form a plan quickly, discuss quickly and adjust quickly. Designers can focus on the core of the product structure and frame layer. The biggest advantage of it is time-saving and efficient because of its prototype, so that others do not pay attention to the details of the interface but rather the function.

                            Low fidelity prototyping can help discover the issues of design and get them resolved at the early stage, with much less time and effort. An interesting and proven phenomenon is that the low-fi prototyping has become a preferred choice for both start-ups and giant brands.

                            High fidelity design are quite close to the final product, with lots of functionality and details included. This is often used in the later usability evaluation to discover the potential issues that may exist in the workflow, interactivity and so on.

                            Most low-fidelity wireframes communicate function well, but communicate form poorly. This is especially the case for mobile applications that have standard interface components with a consistent look and feel. A high-fidelity wireframe of a mobile application will communicate the user interface form and function better because the wireframe better resembles the standard interface components that users are familiar with.</p>

                            <p className="content-text-18"> On a high-fidelity wireframe, there’s also no question to clients about what’s a button or text field because the gradient detail on the elements tell them that. Low-fidelity wireframes don’t give the gradient details that clients need to tell what each interface element is and how they function. Both form and function are key to the user experience. Reducing the form of your user interface too much could impact how clients view your wireframes.

                            The design critique is an expert analysis that examines the current site or application screens in comparison to industry standards and established best practices. This helps to point out areas of opportunity that can be addressed during the design process in an effort to best the competition. This critique results in a presentation of findings that includes both areas of opportunities and concrete recommendations.

                            When an engagement centers on a complex tool for the enterprise, the Consolidated Workflow Diagram captures activity across organizational roles and provides stakeholders a single view of all of the work accomplished in and around a tool. This diagram gives stakeholders an “aha!” moment as, for the first time, they have a picture of the duties employees or customers accomplish in their work lives. Through the use of a consolidated workflow diagram, WDS sees how a user moves through tasks and extrapolates from here to the various cognitive states a user inhabits while engaged with the solution or process. These cognitive states represent a model of what is in people’s minds as they do their work: their mental model. This understanding has implications for both design and marketing.

                             UI kits are comprehensive resource sets that allow you to plan your design’s structure properly without having to sacrifice  creative and original ideas. A UI kit generally contains an assortment of graphic files including UI components (buttons, check boxes, progress bars, etc.) for the purpose of user interface design. This allows developers to create outstanding visuals in a reasonable time frame. So instead of wasting time figuring out how to implement components, UI kits let you focus on what you do best: creating great products.

                                Testing before development begins is crucial to the success of any project. Observing users actions on the prototype can provide insight into what's working and what needs to be discarded or rethought.

                            One of the most important aspect of the product building process is to gather feedback. With prototyping you can observe the user, test the work flow consolidation and collect reviews at every stage of developing the product. Prototypes are extremely helpful when adding new features or redesigning parts of the product. Test what is working for the audience and what is not.

                        WDS has been designing user interfaces for over twenty years. They originally designed user interfaces for websites, but that changed with their first complicated industrial user interface  designed for Motorola. Since then the UI design services expanded to all consumer-facing touchpoints, including software, mobile, SaaS and kiosks.
