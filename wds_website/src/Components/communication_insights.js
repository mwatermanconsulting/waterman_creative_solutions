                            At the beginning of an engagement, we set the foundation for success by developing an understanding of the business, the industry, the competition and relevant trends. This becomes the basis for how we approach all subsequent phases. Along with secondary research, we interview stakeholders and subject matter experts, both to gain a first-hand awareness of the company context, and also to build connections within the business which contribute to stakeholder alignment throughout the engagement. This activity begins to define hypotheses for where the company intends to play in the market, who it intends to serve and how it plans to serve them.</p>

                            Using techniques from the fields of anthropology, psychology, product development and design, we use methods such as “contextual inquiry” to observe and record a rich variety of data, including body language, how people interact with their tools and how they construct their environments to be successful in their worlds. The value here is seeing and finding unexpected elements which lead to surprising insights.</p>

                            When an engagement centers on a complex tool for the enterprise, the Consolidated Workflow Diagram captures activity across organizational roles and provides stakeholders a single view of all of the work accomplished in and around a tool.

                            Through the use of a Consolidated Workflow Diagram, we see how a user moves through tasks and we extrapolate from here to the various cognitive states a user inhabits while engaged with the solution or process.
                            These cognitive states represent a model of what is in people’s minds as they do their work: their mental model. This understanding has implications for both design and marketing.</p>

                            The cognitive states can help to inform the interface for a new way to navigate and complete tasks in a software tool.
