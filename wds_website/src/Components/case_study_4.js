                            Most CSS issues are very challenging because the problems are not in the code, but instead how the code is organized. The load order of classes influences specificity. A major suggestion that was adopted by OsiSoft was to implement the new CSS specification, Flexbox. This would be the first enterprise Sass application developed with Flexbox. </p> 
                        <p className="content-text-18"> 
                            WDS devised a CSS strategy to solve all the current CSS issues. The solution would include: custom CSS classes, Sass, OOCSS and ITCSS. Also there would be a set of global classes, helper classes and Sass mixins. The scalability solution included a plan of modular CSS and Sass partial files. This solution solves the problem of multiple developers working on the project by breaking up the CSS into digestible pieces, moving away from the common practice of developing on one singular CSS file.</p> 
                        <p className="content-text-18">
                            The most important solution  dealt with the global nature of CSS and the specificity problems. This is a complicated issue. The best practice is writing vanilla CSS, with the KISS approach, keep it simple stupid! There are three elements involved in diminishing specificity issues. DRY CSS, Object Oriented CSS and partial file load order. </p>

                        Flexbox was the first CSS upgrade that allowed  designers to have some real control over their layout. Before Flexbox the CSS had to be hacked to get a design correct. Flexbox actually allowed centering items horizontally and vertically. WDS jumped at the chance to apply Flexbox on an enterprise level. Going in uncharted territory, they successfully wrote thousands of lines of Flexbox code, building the application layout from scratch. Frustratingly, they learned that it was NOT the solution to the CSS layout issues. But, Flexbox did help in many ways during the course of the application creation. </p>

                        The most effective Sass feature for organization was the use of partial files(SCSS). Sass partial files allow you to create separate CSS file for each page or sections of a site or app and compile the separate files into one large master file. For example, the footer file would have a matching SCSS file. These files are then processed by the preprocessor and a full production CSS file is written. The power of the partial files became really beneficial when mixed in with the ITCSS method. </p>
                        
                        <p className="content-text-18">
                        The implementation of SaaS was beneficial as the project progressed and the CSS matured. The use of color variables helped maintain consistency, especially as the style guide and design system were being developed. WDS developed a design system a few years later and the use of Sass mixins was critical as we identified classes within the pattern library to utilize to stylize Angular components for the design system.</p>

                        Organizing and naming conventions are the two most difficult things to solve when writing large amounts of CSS. When you have an entire team writing to one CSS file it can become a specificity nightmare,  an unsustainable situation. This method is a great solution to the problem. Using partial files to load the CSS files in order of importance, global to specific. The most global files load first, then the most specific files last. This method mirrors the how the browser DOM interprets the CSS when it is loaded, loading a nice smooth line instead of a bunch of sharp lines. This is a method created by Harry Roberts and it scales nicely in the real enterprise world.</p>

                            OOCSS develops dry, reusable modular chunks of CSS. It’s an approach for writing CSS that’s fast, maintainable, and standards-based, adding much needed predictability to CSS. The OOCSS approach creates an easy to understand vanilla CSS. OOCSS played a large part in this project success. OOCSS is a strange animal as it is not a framework or methodology, but a philosophical perception. In their experience the deeper the knowledge of CSS the more value you get out of the OOCSS method. This method was extensively used throughout the project.</p>
                            
                            <p className="content-text-18"> 
                            Initially, there was pushback from the developers and engineers because OOCSS destroys semantic HTML. Since the CSS is broken down in granular modules there are a lot more classes. The benefits far outweigh the negative of breaking the semantic structure. WDS explained that the CSS classes in the HTMl now tells a story. In six months from now when you open up this file you will quickly understand the CSS and it will make sense. </p>  

                            <p className="content-text-18"> 
                            As the OsiSoft application grew and the CSS matured, the majority of classes needed by the developers were already written. The spacing, color and global classes were written so the developers just added the classes to the HTML, reducing the need for developers to write CSS by 80%.

                            Helper classes help remove repetition by creating a set of abstract classes that can be used over and over on HTML elements. Each helper class is responsible for doing one job and doing it well. Doing this will make  code more reusable and scalable for many features that will be added in the future. Whenever you need to develop a new component, you’ll just need to combine some classes together to build it. </p>

                    The decision to add the Kendo UI brought on a whole new set of challenges, not only for WDS, but the entire team. Frameworks are fine components are added to a template or cookie cutter UI. Once it is necessary to customize these frameworks, the nightmare begins. Considering the PI Vision application was completely custom any components would need to be updated for consistency.</p>
                    <p className="content-text-18">
                    Rollover colors, border colors and most user interactions need to be updated to match the current application design pattern. The problem was updating a simple CSS class, which caused unexpected results. Only a CSS expert could understand the complexity of the kendo CSS file. A plan needed to be enacted in to provide a set of standards to editing the Kendo CSS to avoid the specificity problems. </p>
                    <p className="content-text-18">
                    Working closely with the team, WDS was able to establish a solution involving the partial files and establish a methodology with a best of practices. Once the team was mentored on the framework and methodology the issues dissolved.</p>

                                Once the development of the CSS was completed, documentation and best of practice documents were composed and became the foundation for the living style guide. The CSS spawned a best of practices document that included rules for the global CSS, helper classes and Flexbox classes. A living style guide was created to help with the companies consistency issues within their product line.</p>

                        The CSS scaled beautifully as the project grew. At one point in the project, over 70 engineers simultaneously worked on the CSS with very little issues. During the final phase of the project, engineers were writing very little new CSS classes. </p>
                        <p className="content-text-18">
                        WDS even surprised itself at how well the CSS scaled while it matured. OOCSS mixed with a set of helper classes created a condition where the engineers no longer had to write CSS classes except in rare cases. WDS was very empathetic to the engineers on their daily CSS journey and were thrilled to almost eliminate the burden to code in CSS.</p>
