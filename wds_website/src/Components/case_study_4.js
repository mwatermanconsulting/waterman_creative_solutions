                            CSS issues are very challenging because the problems are not in the code, but instead how the code is organized. The load order of classes influences specificity. One major suggestion that was adopted by OsiSoft was to implement the new CSS specification, flexbox. This would be the first enterprise sass application developed with flexbox. </p> 
                        <p className="content-text-18"> T
                            WDS devised a CSS strategy to solve all the current problems. The application would be coded in custom CSS, Sass, OOCSS and ITCSS. A set of global classes, helper classes and Sass mixins would be included. The scalability solution would include a plan of modular css and sass partial files. This solution also solves multiple developers working on a project by breaking up the CSS in digestible pieces, moving away from the common practice of developing on one singular CSS file. Which is the current workflow that most developers use and the cause for most CSS files.</p>

                            The most important issue deals with global nature of CSS the specificity problems. This is a complicated issue. The best practice is writing vanilla CSS, the KISS approach, keep it simple stupid! There are three elements involved in diminishing specificity issues. DRY CSS, Object Oriented CSS and partial file load order. </p>

                        Flexbox was the first CSS upgrade that allowed CSS designers to have some real control over our layout. Before flexbox we had to hack our way through CSS to get a design correct. Flexbox actually allowed us to center items horizontal and vertical. We jumped at the chance to apply flexbox on an enterprise level. Going in uncharted territory, we successfully wrote thousands of lines of flexbox code, building the application layout from scratch. Frustratingly, learning that it was NOT our savior to our CSS layout issues. But, flexbox did help in many ways during the course of the application creation. </p>

                        The most effective Sass feature for organization is the use of partial files(SCSS). Sass partial files allow you to create separate CSS file for each page or sections of a site or app and compile the separate files into one large master file. For example, the footer file would have a matching SCSS file. These files are then processed by the preprocessor and a full production CSS file is written. The power of the partial files became really beneficial when mixed the ITCSS method. </p>
                        
                        <p className="content-text-18">
                        The implementation of SaaS was beneficial as the project progressed and the CSS matured. The use of color variables, helped maintain consistency especially as the style guide and design system were being developed. As we developed a design system a few years later the use of mixins was critical as we identified classes within the pattern library to utilize to stylize Angular components for the design system.</p>

                        Organizing and naming conventions are the two most difficult things to solve when writing large amounts of CSS. When you have an entire team writing to one CSS file it can become a specificity nightmare. As a project matures over time it truly becomes an unsustainable situation. This method is a great solution to the problem. Using partial files you load the CSS files in order of importance. The most global files load first and while the most specific files load last. The files are loaded in the exact way how the browsers interprets the CSS when it is loaded into the DOM. Loading a nice smooth line instead of a bunch of sharp lines. This is the method created by Harry Roberts and it scales nicely in the real enterprise world.</p>

                            OOCSS develops dry, reusable modular chunks of CSS. It’s an approach for writing CSS that’s fast, maintainable, and standards-based, adding much needed predictability to CSS. The OOCSS approach creates easy to understand vanilla CSS. OOCSS played a large part in this project. OOCSS is a strange animal as it is not a framework or methodology, but a perception a philosophy. In our experience the deeper the knowledge of CSS the more value you get out of the OOCSS method. This method was used extensively throughout the project.</p>
                            
                            <p className="content-text-18"> 
                            Initially there was pushback from the developers and engineers because OOCSS destroys semantic HTML. Since the CSS is broken down in granular modules there are a lot more classes. The benefits out weigh the negatives of breaking the semantic structure. WDS explained that the CSS classes in the HTMl now tells a story. In six months from now when you open up this file you will now quickly what the CSS is doing and it will make sense. </p>  

                            <p className="content-text-18"> 
                            In the OsiSoft project as the CSS matured the majority of classes needed by the developers were all ready written. The spacing, color and global classes were written so the developers just added the classes to the HTML. Reducing the need for developers to write CSS by 80%.

                            Helper classes can help remove repetition by creating a set of abstract classes that can be used over and over on HTML elements. Each helper class is responsible for doing one job and doing it well. Doing this will make your code more reusable and scalable for many features that will be added in the future. Whenever you need to develop a new component, you’ll just need to combine some classes together to build it. </p>

                    The decision to add the Kendo UI brought on a whole new set of challenges, not only for me, but the entire team. Frameworks are fine if you are adding the components to a template or cookie cutter UI. Once you need to customize these frameworks, the nightmare begins. Considering the PI Vision application was completely custom any components would need to be updated.</p>
                    <p className="content-text-18">
                    Things like rollover colors, border colors and most user interactions needs to be updated to match the current application design pattern. Updating the simple CSS class caused unexpected results. Only a CSS expert could understand the complexity of the kendo CSS file.  A plan needed to be enacted in order that we didn’t go backwards to specificity problems again. </p>
                    <p className="content-text-18">
                    Working with the team I was able to establish a solution involving the partial files and establish a methodology, a best of practices. Once the team was mentored on the framework and methodology most of the issues dissolved.</p>

                                After the initial development of the CSS was completed, documentation and best of practice documents were written as the foundation for the living style guide. The  CSS was documented and a best of practice document was written for global CSS, helper classes and flexbox. A living style guide was created to help with the companies consistency issues within their product line.</p>

                        The CSS scaled beautifully as the project grew. At one point in the project, over 70 engineers were simultaneously working on the CSS with very little issues. During the final phase of the project, engineers were writing very little new CSS classes. </p>

                        WDS even surprised itself at how well the CSS scaled while it matured. OOCSS mixed with a set of helper classes created a condition where the engineers no longer had to write CSS classes, except in rare cases. WDS was very empathic to the engineers on their daily CSS journey and were thrilled to almost eliminate the burden to code in CSS.</p>
