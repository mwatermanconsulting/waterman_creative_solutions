                            The most meaningful insights for design strategy are developed with a behavior-based understanding of users. WDS UX strategists observe people in context - where they work, play or live - to understand their goals, their needs and aspirations as they go about their daily lives. If a product does not yet exist, this firsthand look helps to identify unmet needs that a product may solve. </p>

                                    Empathy is a very powerful selling tool, because it is human-centric. It’s the new buzz word, but empathy has always been at the heart of WDS designs.  <br/><br/>“Walk in the user’s shoes.” <br></br>“See the problem as if you were experiencing it yourself."<br/>“Observe their daily routines.” <br></br>All of these mantras and behaviors are empathetic techniques that their UX designers have acquired through years of practice. It is part of their daily lives. </p>

                        The science of understanding people has developed for centuries, but not enough has been done to integrate these approaches into the process of software design. 
                        For more than a decade, WDS has refined a repeatable, flexible methodology that centers on answering questions about customers through direct observational fieldwork 
                        or interviews to identify people’s needs, behaviors and aspirations. This provides a perspective on customers that clients typically have never seen.</p>
