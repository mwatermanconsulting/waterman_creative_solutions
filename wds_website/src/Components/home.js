                        WDS designs user interfaces that delivers valuable experiences by connecting with people on aspirational and emotional levels.</p>
                    <p className="content-text-18">
                        The science of understanding people has developed for centuries, but not enough has been done to integrate these approaches into the process of software design. 
                        For more than a decade, WDS has refined a repeatable, flexible methodology that centers on answering questions about customers through direct observational fieldwork 
                        or interviews to identify people’s needs, behaviors and aspirations. This provides a perspective on customers that clients typically have never seen.</p>
