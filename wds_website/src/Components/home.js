                    <p className="subtitle">We design user interfaces that delivers valuable experiences, connecting with people on aspirational and emotional levels</p>
                    <p className="content-text-18">The science of understanding people has developed for centuries, but not enough has been done to integrate these approaches into the process of software design. 
                        For more than a decade, we have refined a repeatable, flexible methodology that centers on answering questions about customers through direct observational fieldwork 
                        or through interviews to identify people’s needs, behaviors and aspirations. This provides a perspective on customers that clients typically have never seen.</p>
                        <p className="content-text-18">The aim of this work is not more data, but for an understanding. We create a strategy for the experience that the software design will provide. 
                        It's a framework that allows developers, designers, marketers and architects to make decisions that support the intended customer experience. Integrated offering takes 
                        insights from the field and manifests them in a designed software user interface that engages customers and improves business results.</p>
