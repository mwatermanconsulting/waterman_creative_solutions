                    Responsive web design is the approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the userâ€™s behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation. WDS has made countless responsive websites and applications. They were one of the first companies to build a responsive enterprise application using flexbox. WDS can mentor your developers on responsive design best practices, or provide a responsive design <a className="greenlink" href="../ui_design" >build kit.</a>

                    CSS preprocessors are scripting languages that extend the default capabilities of CSS. They enable us to use logic in our CSS code, such as variables, nesting, inheritance, mixins, functions, and mathematical operations. CSS preprocessors make it easy to automate repetitive tasks, reduce the number of errors and "code bloat," by creating reusable code snippets, that ensures backward compatibility.
