                            Narrative User Scenarios enable WDS teams to avoid the trap of focusing on prescriptive solutions too early in the process because it limits the innovation space before it is explored. They are based on personas and used to imagine the ideal experience for a specific user or customer persona.</p>
                            
                            <p className="content-text-18"> In creating User Scenarios, WDS first defines the solutions at a high level in the context of their use. As the story is written about a person interacting with the application in the course of their day, WDS grounds the scenario in reality by keeping the details of the features and interactions out. This enables designers to imagine the best possible solution. The User Scenarios have the added importance of containing the key user interactions, in story form, that the solution must support. With further definition, these are used as the inputs to the epics and user stories that are the beginning stages of a product backlog.</p>
