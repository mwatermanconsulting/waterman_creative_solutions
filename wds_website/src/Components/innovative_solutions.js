                            Narrative User Scenarios enable our teams to avoid the trap of focusing on prescriptive solutions too early in the process which limits the innovation space before it is explored. They are based on personas and used to imagine the ideal experience for a specific user or customer persona.
                            
                            In creating User Scenarios, we first define the solutions at a high level, in the context of their use. As we write out a story of a person interacting with the application in the course of their day, we ground the scenario in reality and, by keeping the details of the features and interactions out of the story, we enable designers to imagine the best possible solutions. The User Scenarios have the added importance of containing the key user interactions, in story form, that the solution must support. With further definition, these are used as the inputs to the epics and user stories that are the beginning stages of a product backlog.</p>

                            In this activity, we take the customer’s goals, as defined in the written user scenarios, and sketch how that user will accomplish them through the interface of the application. A careful focus on how the interactions flow across screens leads to designs that enable users to accomplish their goals in ways that feel natural to them. It provides an intuitive feel to an application which is not achieved when the focus is solely on the visual aspects of an interface.</p>
