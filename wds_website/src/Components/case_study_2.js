                            Every analyst at StubHub were dissatisfied with the new IBM suite of data visualization tools, that the company purchased. They found the platform to be difficult, confusing and cumbersome. One analyst presented an idea to the CTO for a new custom data visualization tool. She agreed and told him to gather a team and make it happen.</p>

                            The first iteration was designed by the analyst. It was crude but functional, and the idea was to sell the idea to a larger stakeholder base. The next phase the newly formed team  subcontracted a UX/UI company to create a redesign the platform. This version contained many new features and it went live with any any user input. It was not well received by the stakeholders or adopted by the larger StubHub base. </p>

                            The team realized it needed a UX/UI consultant with a proven track record. After an extensive search WDS was hired for design skills and methodology. WDS embedded Michael to work closely with with the StubHUb team and reporting back to WDS. </p>

What was the overlying issue that caused the analysts to ignore the platform? How could we observe the users if no one was using the platform. The first step to understanding was to focus our attention on the current UI and complete a design critique and formed a hypothesis. The hypothesis help formed the series of interview questions used to connect with the analysts.  The unique part of StubHub project was we could interview the users directly and ask them about their needs, wants and expectations about the current tool and what they would do differently if designed a internal business intelligence platform. </p>

                            <p className="content-text-18">The discovery phase revealed that the analysts were not using the data reporting tool because of the 3 minute download time. The workflow was that the analysts would request data reports on an array of interests, such as venue analysis. Once the the report was prepared and ready to be consumed the analysts choose their report from the list the and the report would load the data visually in some form of chart. The analysts refuse to use the platform due to the download time. WDS understood that if the team could not get the download time to under a minute, it would be a failure. We told them that we could design the most unique user friendly platform, but without solving this problem, we would have to respectfully decline creating a design. Challenging the team to work on the back-end issues if they wanted WDS to continue working on the project. The team accepted the challenge and completely refactored the back-end to be fast, efficient and secure. </p>

                             In order to gain the attention of the analysts and stakeholders WDS needed to rethink data visualization. Our research showed us that almost all data visualization platform were cold and sterile. Having that grey interface with crude user interfaces. We decided to have a unique design, especially for data visualization. When it came time to present to the team and executives we were unusually nervous. To our surprise it was well received and from that point on the CTO called me "pretty Michael". We explained during the meeting that the design was a modern take on data visualization, the new UI was simple with the stubHub blue and orange branding, bringing a sense of comfort, and most important design feature incorporating numbers into the design.</p>

                                One of the major complaints about the the previous data tool was number display. The numbers were not displayed until the analysts hovered over a data point on a chart. Most analysts were frustrated by this feature, because their workflow involved comparing numbers, which was currently impossible. WDS solution was the numbers to dominant the new design. Large and prominent numbers became the primary design factor. Understanding that analyst only scanned for highs and lows, those numbers were extracted from the chart and displayed in 72 point bold font allowing the primary reporting numbers to be clearly shown. </p>

                                We are always excited when we introduce personas to companies. While presenting if we nail the persona story an understanding begins to take place. For many companies this is the first time they conceptualize someone using their product or service. StubHub was an interesting presentation, as we learned the value of assuming our audience </p>

                                When we made our persona presentation to StubHub, we were surprised by their reaction. We fully expected them to choose one the analysis personas. Instead they choose the executive that we named "Sally,  We began to ask questions to try to understand what the workflows were between the analysts and Sally. We discovered that Sally would receive monthly
                                 reports, PDF's containing the analysis of the data. The reports rarely contained charts, but always included excel data. It was then that we realized that the current design was not meeting Sally's needs, it was designed for the analysts. We needed to rethink the design, possibly a redesign. Our design was based off the analysis persona and a new design would be needed.</p>

                                
                                <p className="content-text-18">Our solution was to incorporate a data table into design. The solution also had to take into account that the data table would not be visible on all the reports. WDS planned from the start to require the design to be responsive and fluid. Adding the data table actually enhanced the visuals of the design and platform. More importantly, the solution expanded the accessibility of the platform to executives, such as "Sally the VP." The extra table made the display accessible to anyone by showing numbers shown in a more granular fashion. The analysts were thrilled the table was added because it eased the work flow of the analyst by aiding in their report creation. </p>

With data in hand we met again with the decision makers showing them the data that less than 1% of the analysts were using these options. Another point we made was that our persona Sally would never use these options. The data was able to convince the stakeholders to that placing these features in an options button, was meeting the needs of majority of users.  </p>
