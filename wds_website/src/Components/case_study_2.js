                            All the analysts at Stubhub were dissatisfied with the new IBM suite of data visualization tools. They found the application to be difficult, confusing and cumbersome. One analyst presented an idea to a CTO for a new custom data visualization tool. She told him to gather a team and make it happen.</p>

                            The first iteration was designed by the analyst. It was crude but functional, and the idea was sold to a larger shareholder base. In the next phase the small team subcontracted a UX/UI person to create a new design with many new features and it went live. It was not well received by the stakeholders or adopted by the larger Stubhub base. </p>

                                The previous data tool did not show the numbers prominently. The analysts had to hover over graphics in the charts for the numbers to appear. Most analysts were frustrated by this feature, and WDS solved this by allowing the numbers to dominant the new design. Large and prominent numbers became the primary design factor.  Primary reporting numbers are clearly shown. The orange table was added later in the design phase, once the team settled on a persona of "Sally the VP." The extra table was added because the VP persona wanted numbers shown in a more granular fashion. Understanding the work flow of the analyst and the addition of the table eased the work flow of the analyst by aiding in their report creation. </p>
