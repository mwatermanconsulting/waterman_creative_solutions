Large are prominant the numbers are the primary design factor.  Primary reporting numbers are clearly shown. The orange table was added later in the design phase, once the team settled on the persona of Sally the VP. The extra table was added due to the fact that the VP persona would want numbers in a more granual fashion. Understanding the work flow of the analyst the addition of the table eased the work flow of the analyst by aiding in their report creation. </p>

They said there was no need to push for more users, they currently had 172 users and there were only 175 analysts in the company. In 5 months the reporting tool went from a 1% total usage to 98% and the team couldn't be happier.  </p>
