                        <p className=" flex-layout-center-center "> As design has evolved, it’s become more cross-functional. Physical, digital, service design have all converged. And that’s great for the end user. 
                                        But from an organizational point of view, that’s very challenging, indeed, to manage. And because all these different forces have come together at once, it 
                                        means that that act of making ] stand-out products and services that really delight customers is harder than ever before for many companies out there. <br/>
                                        good design is good for business <br/>
                                        Empathizing with a user or customer is the key method or the key activity in great design that I don’t think is really translatable to data or analytics or 
                                        any of those things. Design brings empathy into the problem-solving process. That’s the qualitative intangible. <br/>

Defining and adhering to standards is how we create that understanding. Doing so removes the subjectivity and ambiguity that often creates friction and confusion within product teams.
                                        Standards encompass both design and development. Standardizing things like naming conventions, accessibility requirements, and file structure will help teams work consistently and prevent errors.
                                        Visual language is a core part of your design standards. Defining the purpose and style of color, shape, type, icons, space, and motion is essential to creating a brand aligned and consistent user experience. Every component in your system incorporates these elements, and they play an integral role in expressing the personality of your brand.
