                            Great strategies for software are built on rich insight. The most meaningful insights for experience strategy are developed with a deep, behavior-based understanding of users or customers. Our experience strategists observe people in context - where they work, play or live - to understand their goals, needs and aspirations as they go about their daily lives. If a product does not yet exist, this first-hand look helps to identify unmet needs that a product may solve.</p>

                            Using techniques from the fields of anthropology, psychology, product development and design, we use methods such as “contextual inquiry” to observe and record a rich variety of data, including body language, how people interact with their tools and how they construct their environments to be successful in their worlds. The value here is seeing and finding unexpected elements which lead to surprising insights.</p>

                            To get to the core of what they care about, we also open authentic dialogues with customers to hear the stories that define their experiences.</p>

                            When an engagement centers on a complex tool for the enterprise, the Consolidated Workflow Diagram captures activity across organizational roles and provides stakeholders a single view of all of the work accomplished in and around a tool. This diagram gives stakeholders an “aha!” moment as, for the first time, they have a picture of the duties employees or customers accomplish in their work lives. </p>

                            Through the use of a Consolidated Workflow Diagram, we see how a user moves through tasks and we extrapolate from here to the various cognitive states a user inhabits while engaged with the solution or process.
                            These cognitive states represent a model of what is in people’s minds as they do their work: their mental model. This understanding has implications for both design and marketing.</p>

                            The cognitive states can help to inform the interface for a new way to navigate and complete tasks in a software tool. By aligning with how people think about their work, we produce tools that feel intuitive and easy to use. This understanding also provides an input to marketing, providing marketers with key information for creating a communication plan that resonates with customers. </p>

After the investment in deep customer understanding, the results can be shared among many departments to increase their value to the company.
                            The framework is a set of principles or questions that guide the development of ideas for solutions as well as the subsequent work performed by multiple teams in developing and marketing those solutions: architects, marketers, designers, branders, etc. This decision-making framework is valuable because it puts to work the understanding of the needs and concerns of the customer group, captured in the field observations.
