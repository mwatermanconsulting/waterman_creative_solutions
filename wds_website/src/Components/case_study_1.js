                            WDS was hired after two failed attempts to design a modern user-centric interface for the the high-end Cable modem the MOTOROLA DOCSIS 3.1, Model MB8600. Through methodology research findings and walking in the users' shoes, WDS's solutions became industry standard, surviving two buyouts, even presenting to Google stakeholders and marketing teams to justify our endeavor mid-development. The design solutions were adopted by both companies.</p>

                            The design solutions led the industry since 2013 and many of the solutions are now standard across the product line and adopted by the competitors. WDS goal of returning Motorola as the industry standard was accomplished, under the Arris name. Below is the story on how WDS accomplished this feat.</p>

                            Motorola was facing a high return rate on a product line with a monthly rise in call center calls. 
                            There was political pressure to release the new DOCSIS 3.1 tech on the SurfBoard product line. The product managers knew that if they released the new tech without fixing the current problems with the interface, the product line would lose money. But, after 18 months and two failed attempts the pressure was on the home division to correct the problems and get this new technology to market before their competitors.

                                One of the first requirements required Motorola to purchase all the competitors modems. Usually, as was with the case of Motorola competition is ignored. The competitors research is one of the highlights of the methodology as it enlightens the stakeholders on their competition. WDS will revisit the competition as solutions begin to materialize. WDS goal for all our clients is to be a leader. Being a leader is not possible without knowing your competition.</p>

                            For the average user, the interface on the Motorola modems was very intimidating. The UI was outdated and unbranded, leaving the user confused and frustrated. This kept the call center very busy.</div>

                                The user base for the modems was broad and it was difficult to apply our normal methodology of observing and interviewing users. WDS methodology is flexible and adaptable our we turned to a quote by the Bill Gates Quote “Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning.”Remembering what a stakeholder told us about the high volume of call center calls, WDS requested three months of call center calls and a week to "ghost" call center calls. With this information we started to see patterns and begin to establish a numeric based error system to uncover and document the truth to the problems. In this phase and to becoming the user. Emphasizing with the task they need to complete. Viewing the problems and issues through the eyes of the user.</p>

                                As WDS uncovered the truth about users, a connection developed and personalities traits began to take shape and take form into personas and journey maps. A customer/user persona would be needed for this project to be a success. A bridge of empathy between the user and Motorola's developers. The persona of Sally was born.

                                    WDS noticed early in the project that the organization of inputs did not make sense. When the team information expert reviewed the interface and made suggested changes we learned that there was two set of users. The consumer who would purchase the product and the cable operators doing home internet connection. WDS would not be allowed to move ANY input. Originally we thought this requirement was limiting, instead it forced us to adapt our solutions. Sometime being forced to change course opens new possibilities designing a final product the was beyond the scope and expectations of the customers and shareholders.</p>

                            One of the biggest challenges we faced was the simplifying the WiFi section. Work flows could not be simplified by organizing the inputs in a logical order, due to the limitation of two unique users cable operators and consumers. We needed to approach this differently, and as a result the "WiFi Quick Start" idea was born. </p>
                            
                            <p className="content-text-18">Working closely with developers, we attempted to reduce the number of questions the user needed to answer to set up their WiFi. Currently the user needed to fill out nine inputs to complete the task. The goal was to reduce the user inputs from 9 to 5 and eliminate the need to input the 12 digit mac number, losing this number was a common issue. The only way to accomplish this was for a developer to create an algorithm to automate the process with little user input.</p>

                            <p className="content-text-18">The quick start idea was game changing. It took over a year for the industry to adopt this approach</p>

                            These solution were born from empathy and walking in the user shoes. WDS knew for this project to be a success the customer needed to feel supported and guided. A new approach to the help treatment needed to be developed. None of the competitors solutions to the guide the user through help sections, especially any form of in-context help, one even had the nerve to offer on-line help. WDS solved this problem elegantly, allowing the user to click on the help link and a row opens below to reveal the answers. This solution tested very well during the testing phase</p>

                                    How did a global brand like Motorola allow a such a poorly designed, non-branded user interface on a consumer product, go to market? It was mind boggling. Our first question to the stakeholders was, "how did this product UI fall through the cracks?" This issue exposed a large communication issue between product, marketing and home division. WDS set-up sprint cycle meetings every three weeks along with milestones meetings. These meetings ran the course of the project and established a strong relationship between the teams that was previously non-existent. </p>

                                The home division, managers and developers were out of touch with their users. WDS developed a persona to alleviate this issue. After our initial research we decided on a user called "Sally". Sally really helped bridge the gap between WDS and the developers. WDS made her personality a mother in-law, who was not very tech savvy. Knowing that many engineers and developers get calls from their mother in-laws asking for computer help it was the perfect personality to bring empathy to the team. Many times when we proposed solution and we got push back from the team we would ask; "If we don't implement this solution, would you get a phone call from Sally?"  </p>

                            WDS always uses the golden rule when we hand a project off. We try to come up with use cases and future problems. Final handoff for Motorola consisted of CSS and HTML cleanup and implementing .asp tags for the final build. A pattern library and documentation, including best of practices, was created for the CSS files. Most importantly, the final build size was 985kb, phew.

WDS figured all Motorola public facing products would be branded. WDS solved this by correcting the communication issues between the teams, specifically marketing, product and home division. At the start of the project WDS organized monthly and milestone meetings between the teams. Product, marketing and home division communication was still strong well after WDS left. The approved design was going to be adapted to the rest of the product line. The design today may look different, branded under the Arris name, but many of the design solution we implemented are still in use today.

                                <p className="content-text-18"> The original design did not take the user into account. It was cold and uninviting there was know empathy and little guidance for the user. Our main goal was to design an inviting familiar interface that would guide the user through their tasks. There are very few people that enjoy setting up their WiFi. We knew we reached our goal when CNet reviewed the interface and stated "The Surfboard eXtreme has a robust and self-explanatory Web interface". Self explanatory is the goal for any UX prpject.
