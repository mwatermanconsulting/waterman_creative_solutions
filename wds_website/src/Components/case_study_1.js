The return rate was reaching close to twenty percent and large increase in call center volume. DOCSIS 3.1 technology for the SURFboard product line was put onhold until the problems related to the product line were solved. After 18 months and two failed attempts management team decided to find a vendor that was a true UX designer with a proven methodology with design skills. After an initial consultation, WDS was hired to to use their methodology to figure out what went wrong and come to a design solution.

In the case of Motorola this was not possible, due to the large usage base. Instead WDS adapted its methodology to study a three month block of call center calls, as well as ghosting call center calls for a week. With this information we started to see patterns and begin to establish a numeric based error system to uncover the truth to the problems. In this phase it is critical to become the user. Emphazing with the task they need to complete. Viewing the problems and issues through the eyes of the user. Another pattern that is always uncovered is user personalities types. Which leads to the creation of personas, journey maps and task flows. </p>

WDS figured all Motorola public facing products would be branded. WDS solved this by correcting the communication issues between the teams, specifically marketing, product and home division. At the start of the project WDS organized monthly and milestone meetings between the teams. Product, marketing and home division communication was still strong well after WDS left. The approved design was going to be adapted to the rest of the product line.</p>
