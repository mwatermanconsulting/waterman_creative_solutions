                            Another benefit of using prebuilt and standardized component is less errors. There’s no chance of making a mistake when you’re copying from a master version. As long as the components in your design system are accurate, their use in your products will be accurate.
                            This is especially good news for developers, who have all the code snippets they need right at their fingertips.

                                Having this kind of master reference guide also helps avoid miscommunication. By offering a definitive protocol and standards for otherwise ambiguous elements, design systems keep everyone on the same page. No guesswork, assumptions, or “going rogue.” Design systems also do wonders for problematic developer handoffs. Technical specs are embedded in the document which creates less confusion about how to build something in the backend, or whether it can be built at all. Design systems give designers and developers a shared language.</p>

                            Consistency is vital for a pleasant user experience, but it can be hard to come by with multiple designers working separately. Design systems allow easy access to universal versions of design assets (and their rules) to keep everyone on the same page and ensure consistency from one page or section to another.
                            That also holds true for different products. Brands looking to build their identity can use the exact same assets for all their products, giving everything a unified feel and rewarding loyal customers with familiar usability.</p>

                            <p className="content-text-18"> It’s understood that the design system is the official document: every time a change needs to be made, it’s made there. Whenever a bug gets fixed or a new design component is introduced, it’s recorded into the design system so that the next person to use it stays up-to-date automatically. WDS likes to call it a “living document” because it’s always updating.<br></br>
                            This format of using only one, agreed-upon master document also ensures that every update gets made to the same file. You never have to merge multiple files that were updated independently of each other by different team members. Whenever you pull from the design system, you know you’re always using the most recent version. This significantly reduces the margin for error.</p>

                            WDS sets design standards for a foundation, assimilating design with software development by fostering empathy for the software engineers. Asking questions and learning the language helps bridge the gap between the customer and developer.<br></br>
                            Design systems help keep your UX data organized by optimizing patterns. When updates occur communicating the updates to the design system so that every designer and developer knows it’s the new norm going forward.
