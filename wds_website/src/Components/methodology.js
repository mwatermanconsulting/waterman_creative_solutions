                                        <p>The science of understanding people has developed for centuries, but not enough has been done to integrate these approaches into the process of software development. 
                                            Over more than a decade, we have refined a repeatable, programmatic methodology that centers on answering questions about customers through direct observational fieldwork to identify 
                                            peopleâ€™s needs, behaviors and aspirations. This provides a perspective on customers that clients typically have never seen.
                                            The aim of this work is not more data; most companies are swimming in information. Instead, we create a strategy for the experience that the software will provide. 
                                            It's a framework that allows developers, designers, marketers and architects to make decisions that support the intended customer experience. WDS integrated offering takes insights from the 
                                            field and manifests them in developed software that engages customers and improves business results. <br/>
