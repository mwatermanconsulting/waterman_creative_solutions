                        <p>The foundation of everything we do is design </p>

                        <p>Since 1997 WDS has been evangelizing design under its original name, Surreal Concepts. Started by the husband and wife team, Terri and Michael Waterman, they began with a simple premise and small list of design services. Our business has evolved with the digital revolution. Officially, surreal concepts by aligning a partnership with a flexographic label company. We designed and prepared the documents for plates for the printing press. </p>

                        <p>By early 2000, Surreal Concepts moved their talents to the digital world. Becoming experts in everything Adobe. Adding HTML, CSS and Flash the two partners turned their attention to the web. Offering design solutions for small companies. Bringing a level of professionalism to their online presence. </p>

                        <p>The design solutions we provided were successful, but we starting thinking to ourselves we are developing designs that are all about the business. What about the users? Are our web designs resonating with their customers? We set out to understand how people interacted with websites. Trying to find the answers to the questions. What were their needs and expectations? How did people interact with a web page compared to traditional ways? In 2003, a study was released by B.J. Fogg and his team at Stanford University released the first study on human interaction on websites. This study changed not not only how we designed, but our company focus. </p>

                        <p>In early 2005 Surreal Concepts released a website call webfirst. Based off the research from Stanford University, developed a friendly version of the high level information. Writing user friendly content with bright colors with the goal of enlightening businesses of the value of understanding the users. Michael repurposed the content for webfirstaid, for a series of talks on UX and Design. </p> 

                    
                        <p>The talks lead directly to the engagement with Pfizer in 2007. Surreal Concepts, embedded Michael in the project. The project was Pfizer Pro, the largest HCP website, at the time. We were contracted for the UX Design, developing content strategies, front-end development and bi-weekly updates. During the engagement Michael's business understanding helped Pfizer by documenting a business problem, they had with a vendor. A CMS solution and support was costing Pfizer thousands of dollars a week on lost man hours and poor customer service. This insight gave Pfizer the knowledge they needed to change vendors and recoup their money from the vendor. </p>

                        Surreal Concepts started to make a name for itself for its design and business solutions. Motorola had a large problem that they could not solve with their modem product line. For years the return rate on their line of modems was rising, call center costs were out of control. After two failed attempts, Surreal Concepts was hired and Michael was Embedded on the team. We were contracted for UX design, UI design and development and also to provide business solutions. This was our venture into complex product user interfaces.

Web design was in its infancy, and she joined a web team by 1998, creating intranet websites for different divisions to improve group communication. Knowledge of code was crucial to digital design, and she fostered relationships with other software engineers to learn about their craft in order to assimilate design to their products.</p>

                            <p className="content-text-18">Surreal Concepts design solutions were successful. But we starting thinking to ourselves; what do the people that are interacting with the websites think? Are our web designs resonating with their customers? We set out to understand how people interacted with websites. What were their needs and expectations? How did people interact with a web page compared to traditional ways? In 2003, a study was released by B.J. Fogg and his team at Stanford University releasing the first study on human interaction on websites. Observing peoples eye movements, click behavior and user experience. This study changed not not only how we designed, but our company focus. </p>

                            

                            <p className="content-text-18">In early 2005 Surreal Concepts released a website call webfirst. Based off the research from Stanford University, developed a friendly version of the high level information. Writing user friendly content with bright colors with the goal of enlightening businesses of the value of understanding the users. Michael repurposed the content for webfirstaid, for a series of talks on UX and Design. </p>

During the engagement Michael's business understanding helped Pfizer by documenting a business problem, they had with a vendor. A CMS solution and support was costing Pfizer thousands of dollars a week on lost man hours and poor customer service. This insight gave Pfizer the knowledge they needed to change vendors and recoup their money from the vendor. Read the full story </p>

After two failed attempts, Surreal Concepts was hired and Michael was embedded on the team. We were contracted for UX design, UI design and development and to provide business solutions. This was our venture into complex product user interfaces and tested the scalability of our UX methodology. Read the full story

                        <p className="content-text-18"> Michael was raised in a creative family and spent his childhood creating, designing and drawing. As Michael matured he began a career in retail. His friendly and caring nature made him a natural at customer service and he quickly climbed the corporate ladder becoming a regional manager in his early twenties. </p>

                            <p className="content-text-18">
                            Life changed after he married Terri. She thought Michaelâ€™s talents were being wasted in retail and being an artist herself she inspired him to revisit his creativity.</p>

                            <p className="content-text-18">
                            In the early nineties, Michael left retail and took a year off to learn computers and digital design and video editing. Michael learned Photoshop, version 3.5, Illustrator and video editing. Michael having the entrepreneurial spirit and wanted to start his own design company. Along with Terri they choose a name that was very fitting for them at the time, Surreal Concepts. The name was chosen to portray the message that our designs are different and will help you stand out. </p>

                            <p className="content-text-18">We needed a portfolio. He decided to create a series of coupons, like those of in penny savers we all got in the mail. He made up names, logos and designed a dozen coupons and developed a portfolio. At his first interview he got a job as a contractor under Surreal Concepts. This was the start of Surreal Concepts and his design career.
                            </p>

                            <p className="content-text-18">As soon as the internet boom happened, Michael learned how to code in HTML, CSS and Flash and Surreal Concepts shifted focus to website design. While designing sites a thought occurred to Michael; Do the users of websites we design and develop have an enjoyable experience? He began researching what people expected from the website experience. He took his research and new found knowledge and designed, wrote and developed a website call web first aid.</p> 

                            <p className="content-text-18">Web First Aid was an information site written for the average user. This site was developed before UX was a thing. The only other proponent of the user experience was Nielson, whoâ€™s idea of a website back then was just text on a white background. The creation of web first aid opened new opportunities for Surreal Concepts and lead to a contract with Pfizer. </p>

                            <p className="content-text-18">The Pfizer name gave Michael and Surreal Concepts the credibility needed to land the other big names such as Motorola and StubHub. In 2014 Michael left the company to pursue a full time position with OsiSoft as the lead UX/UI designer. </p>

                            <p className="content-text-18">Michael's entrepreneurial spirit got the best of him and he left early last year to rebrand Surreal Concepts to WDS. Applying all his experience to help, guide and support businesses with their design needs. Bringing his successful design strategies and UX methodology to reach all businesses. Michael has witnessed the design needs in large companies, developing strategies and talks. Michael believes that now is the best time for the business because empathic design are more critical to business survival than ever before. Michael has a vision and renewed passion that will make WDS the design leader. </p>

                        <p className="content-text-18 margin-top-25"> "An artistâ€™s strength comes from their perspective of life, the inner dialogue." <br></br>Terri's perspective is greatly influenced by her hearing loss as a child. Since her outer life became quiet, observations and interpretations were always unique and different. She always came from the perspective that if everyone is running in one direction, she's going the opposite way. Her observations taught her that following the crowd was never a good idea to foster creativity. This enables her unique approach. Her fine art training has taught her the importance of staying true to herself. <br></br>A deep thinker, she has always been curious about how humans behave and respond to life, and found that design was about communicating simply so that everyone understood. The cartooning of this website was to convey what WDS is about - good old-fashioned customer service, something that was very prevalent during the 1950s.
                        <br></br>
                        Her experience working with Michael and clients have taught her that design has a purpose of having empathy, and users ALWAYS embrace designs that take them into consideration. </p><p className="subtitle">Design is a guide to help the user's eye see where they're going, intuitively and seamlessly. Terri's passion for helping others with her talent is the only motivation she needs to be passionate about their goals.</p>


                           <p className="content-text-18 margin-top-25">As the heart of WDS, Terri's intuitive design skills come from 25+ years of experience in traditional and modern art. This combination of skills has served her well in all her artistic endeavors. 
                            
                            Serving as a creative advisory to Michael has enabled both to stay ahead of the design trends and competition. Thereâ€™s always a way, she says, to make every business unique. 
                            Her personal work has intertwined with her professional work as a designer. 
                            Evolving into a disciplined UX designer created amazing opportunities as a unique visual communicator. 
                            Her greatest joy is when there is a balance of creative flow along with the discipline of design that creates simplicity and inspiration. </p>
