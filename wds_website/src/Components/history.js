Knowledge of code was crucial to digital design, and she fostered relationships with other software engineers to learn about their craft in order to assimilate design to their products.</p>

                            In early 2002, a UX informational site called Web First Aid was created for website design, which included studies done at Stanford University and the Neilson Norman Group, two credible resources in usability, backed with data to support their research.</p>

                            This site along with the Surreal Concepts website led to a contract with a Pfizer agency to design and organize the largest HCP site at the time. They realized that the same principles of design for small companies were scalable to enterprise levels. Consulting with Pfizer was an opportunity to show that simplicity and efficient communication with strong teamwork helped save Pfizer a half a million dollars.

                                <p className="content-text-18">This is one of the many stories that has describes how Surreal Concepts evolved into what WDS is today. The evolution of our services followed our clients' needs. For Pfizer, it was  tackling  problems and issues with content management systems that didnâ€™t work. Complaints and documentation by Michael  on lost man-hours helped Pfizer to understand the issue and take appropriate action. They replaced the vender, recouping a half a million dollars. Michael has always had an innate sense of business which he applies to his research. Solving business communication issues can solve many of the design issues.</p>

                        <p className="content-text-18"> Michael was raised in a creative family and spent his childhood creating, designing and drawing. As Michael matured he began a career in retail. His friendly and caring nature made him a natural at customer service and he quickly climbed the corporate ladder becoming a regional manager in his early twenties. </p>

                            <p className="content-text-18">
                            Life changed after he married Terri. She thought Michaelâ€™s talents were being wasted in retail and being an artist herself she inspired him to revisit his creativity.</p>

                            <p className="content-text-18">
                            In the early nineties, Michael left retail and took a year off to learn computers and digital design and video editing. Michael learned Photoshop, version 3.5, Illustrator and video editing. Michael having the entrepreneurial spirit and wanted to start his own design company. Along with Terri they choose a name that was very fitting for them at the time, Surreal Concepts. The name was chosen to portray the message that our designs are different and will help you stand out. </p>

                            <p className="content-text-18">We needed a portfolio. He decided to create a series of coupons, like those of in penny savers we all got in the mail. He made up names, logos and designed a dozen coupons and developed a portfolio. At his first interview he got a job as a contractor under Surreal Concepts. This was the start of Surreal Concepts and his design career.
                            </p>

                            <p className="content-text-18">As soon as the internet boom happened, Michael learned how to code in HTML, CSS and Flash and Surreal Concepts shifted focus to website design. While designing sites a thought occurred to Michael; Do the users of websites we design and develop have an enjoyable experience? He began researching what people expected from the website experience. He took his research and new found knowledge and designed, wrote and developed a website call web first aid.</p> 

                            <p className="content-text-18">Web First Aid was an information site written for the average user. This site was developed before UX was a thing. The only other proponent of the user experience was Nielson, whoâ€™s idea of a website back then was just text on a white background. The creation of web first aid opened new opportunities for Surreal Concepts and lead to a contract with Pfizer. </p>

                            <p className="content-text-18">The Pfizer name gave Michael and Surreal Concepts the credibility needed to land the other big names such as Motorola and StubHub. In 2014 Michael left the company to pursue a full time position with OsiSoft as the lead UX/UI designer. </p>

                            <p className="content-text-18">Michael entrepreneurial spirit got the best of him and he left early last year rebrand Surreal Concepts to WDS and apply his newfound business design knowledge. Michael believes that now is the best time for the business because empathic design are more critical to business survival than ever before. Michael has a vision and renewed passion that will make WDS the design leader. </p>

                        <p className="content-text-18 margin-top-25"> "An artistâ€™s strength comes from their perspective of life, the inner dialogue." <br></br>Terri's perspective is greatly influenced by her hearing loss as a child. Since her outer life became quiet, observations and interpretations were always unique and different. She always came from the perspective that if everyone is running in one direction, she's going the opposite way. Her observations taught her that following the crowd was never a good idea to foster creativity. This enables her unique approach. Her fine art training has taught her the importance of staying true to herself. <br></br>A deep thinker, she has always been curious about how humans behave and respond to life, and found that design was about communicating simply so that everyone understood. That's the reason for the type of cartooning of this website, good old fashioned customer service that was very prevelant during the 1950s.
                        <br></br>
                        Her experience working with Michael and clients have taught her that design has a purpose of having empathy, and users ALWAYS embrace designs that take them into consideration. </p><p className="subtitle">Design is a guide to help the user's eye see where they're going, with an intuitively and seamlessly. Terri's passion for helping others with her talent is the only motivation she needs to be passionate about their goals.</p>


                           <p className="content-text-18 margin-top-25">As the heart of WDS, Terri's intuitive design skills come from 25+ years of experience in traditional and modern art. This combination of skills has served her well in all her artistic endeavors. 
                            
                            Serving as a creative advisory to Michael has enabled both to stay ahead of the design trends and competition. Thereâ€™s always a way, she says, to make every business unique. 
                            Her personal work has intertwined with her professional work as a designer. Creating designs for businesses requires research, empathy and most of all, consistency in their branding. 
                            Evolving into a disciplined UX designer created amazing opportunities as a unique visual communicator. 
                            Her greatest joy is when there is a balance of creative flow along with the discipline of design that creates simplicity and inspiration. </p>
