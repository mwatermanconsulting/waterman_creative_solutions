Started by the husband and wife team, Terri and Michael Waterman, they began with a simple premise and small list of design services. The business has evolved alongside the digital revolution, adapting and modifying services to match client needs. From small businesses to global name brands, each experience help them to grow and expand service offerings. Waterman Design Solutions reflect that growth and a new focus. </p>

                        The first time they worked on the Amiga 500, Michael and Terri were fascinated with digital design. With the knowledge and skills that acquired with the digital video software NewTek Video Toaster, they started a business focused on video production services. A client approached them about an Illustrator project for the Franklin Mint, digitally reproducing portraits of sports figures. Becoming experts at Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop sparked their entrepreneurial spirit and Surreal Concepts was born.</p>

                            Surreal Concepts was incorporated in 1997 and started out doing graphic design. They developed a partnership with a flexographic label company,  Apogee, designing and  preparing documents for printing press plates. They also introduced a  printing strategy and set up a schedule that supported the client's needs, eliminating most missed deadlines. Clients here included SmithKline and Boiron Homeopathy. </p>

                            The number of services grew in 1999 after adding more skills in digital video programs such as Adobe Premiere, Adobe AfterEffects and Apple Final Cut Pro. They developed and designed Flash websites, Flash banner ads, animations  and video compression for the web. They constantly learned new skills to meet the demands of clients like InvestorForce and Altvest, delivering high quality animations, banners ads, products, corporate videos, and marketing material. </p>

                            <p className="content-text-18">Surreal Concepts' design solutions were successful. But they starting asking themselves, "What do the people that are interacting with the websites think?" <br></br>"Are our web designs resonating with users?" <br></br>They set out to research how people interacted with websites by asking questions:<br></br> What were their needs and expectations? <br></br>How did people interact with a web page compared to traditional ways? <br></br>In 2003, a study was released by B.J. Fogg and his team at Stanford University revealing the first study on human interaction while on websites. This was done by observing eye movements, click behavior and user experience. This study changed not not only how they designed, but their entire focus. </p>
                        

                            <p className="content-text-18">In early 2005, Surreal Concepts released a website called WebFirstAid, based on research done by Stanford University, which provided a friendly version of  high level educational information about what makes a website work. Writing in a user friendly style with bright colors,  the goal was to enlighten  and inspire businesses about the value of understanding web users. Michael repurposed all the information for a series of talks on UX and Design. </p>

Michael was contracted for the UX Design, developing content strategies, front-end development and bi-weekly updates. During the engagement, Michael's business understanding helped Pfizer by documenting a business problem they had with a vendor. The current CMS program and support was costing Pfizer thousands of dollars a week on lost man hours and extremely poor customer service. This documentation gave Pfizer the knowledge they needed to change vendors and recoup their money.  </p>

After two failed attempts to fix this, Surreal Concepts was contracted for UX design, UI design and development to provide business solutions. This was a complex product user interface and tested the scalability of its UX methodology.

                             After 22 years of business Terri and Michael  evolved to the point of outgrowing Surreal Concepts. After 4 years away from the business, Michael knew it was time to share his knowledge, strategies and methodologies with new and old clients. Surreal Concepts no longer fit with the new services offered, and needed to change strategies. The new services include  design,  business strategies, talks and workshops. Michael has navigated successfully to enterprise businesses, and under the new name Waterman Design Solutions, the team looks forward to changing the design perspective for all sized businesses. </p>

                        <p className="content-text-18"> Michael was raised in a creative family and spent his childhood creating, designing and drawing. As Michael matured he began a career in retail. His friendly and caring nature made him a natural at customer service and he quickly climbed the corporate ladder becoming a regional manager in his early twenties. </p>

                            <p className="content-text-18">
                            Life changed after he married Terri. She thought Michael’s talents were being wasted in retail and being an artist herself she inspired him to revisit his creativity.</p>

                            <p className="content-text-18">
                            In the early nineties, Michael left retail and took a year off to learn computers and digital design and video editing. He gained skills in Photoshop v. 3.5, Illustrator and video editing. Michael, having the entrepreneurial spirit, wanted to start his own design company. Along with Terri they choose a name that was very fitting for them at the time, Surreal Concepts. The name was chosen to portray the message that our designs are different and will help you stand out. </p>

                            <p className="content-text-18"> Michael then  created a series of "penny saver" mailer coupons, making up names, logos and designs of a dozen coupons to develop a portfolio. At his first interview he got a job as a contractor under Surreal Concepts. This was the start of his design career.
                            </p>

                            <p className="content-text-18">As soon as the internet boom occurred, Michael learned how to code in HTML, CSS and Flash and Surreal Concepts shifted focus to website design. While designing sites a thought occurred to him: Do the users of websites They design and develop have an enjoyable experience? He began researching about user expectations and the ideal website experience. He took his research and new found knowledge and designed, wrote and developed a website call WebFirstAid.</p> 

                            <p className="content-text-18">WebFirstAid was an information site written for the average user. This site was developed before UX was a thing. The only other proponent of the user experience was Nielson Norman Group, who’s idea of a website back then was just text on a white background. The creation of web first aid opened new opportunities for Surreal Concepts that lead to a contract with Pfizer. </p>

                            <p className="content-text-18">The Pfizer name gave Michael and Surreal Concepts the credibility needed to land the other big names such as Motorola and StubHub. In 2014 Michael left the company to pursue a full time position with OsiSoft as the lead UX/UI designer. </p>

                            <p className="content-text-18">Michael's entrepreneurial spirit got the best of him and he left in  2018 to rebrand Surreal Concepts to Waterman Design Solutions, applying  his experiences to help, guide and support businesses with their design needs. He brings his successful design strategies and UX methodology to reach all businesses. Michael has witnessed the design needs in large companies, and has developed strategies that are beneficial and necessary for success. Michael believes that now is the best time for the business because empathic design are more critical to business survival than ever before. <br></br>Michael has a vision and renewed passion that will make WDS the design leader. </p>

                        <p className="content-text-18 margin-top-25"> "I aim to inspire." <br></br>Terri's perspective is greatly influenced by her hearing loss as a child. Since her outer life became quiet, observations and interpretations were always unique and different. Her observations taught her that following the crowd was never a good idea to foster creativity, which enables her unique approach. Her fine art training has taught her the importance of staying true to herself. <br></br>A deep thinker, she has always been curious about how humans behave and respond to life, and how design was about communicating simply. Like the cartooning on this site, the goal was to show you how much WDS values good old fashioned customer service, something that was very prevalent in the 1950s.
                        <br></br>
                        Her experience working with Michael and their clients have taught her that design has a purpose of having empathy, and users ALWAYS embrace designs that take them into consideration. </p><p className="subtitle">Terri's passion for helping others with her talent is what motivates her to be passionate about her clients' goals.</p>

                           <p className="content-text-18 margin-top-25">As the heart of WDS, Terri's intuitive design skills come from 25+ years of experience in traditional and modern art. This combination of skills has served her well in all her artistic endeavors. 
                            
                            Serving as a creative advisory to Michael has enabled her to stay ahead of the design trends and competition. There’s always a way, she says, to make every business unique. 
                            Her personal work has intertwined with her professional work as a designer by evolving into a disciplined UX designer, which led to amazing opportunities as a unique visual communicator. 
                            Her greatest joy is when there is a balance of creative flow along with the discipline of design that creates simplicity and inspiration. </p>
