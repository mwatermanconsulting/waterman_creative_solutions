Web design was in its infancy, and she joined a web team by 1998, creating intranet websites for different divisions to improve group communication. Knowledge of code was crucial to digital design, and she fostered relationships with other software engineers to learn about their craft in order to assimilate design to their products. <br></br>
The first big client landed after incorporating as Surreal Concepts was a label manufacturer that did work for Smithkline Beecham in the consumer division. Labels were printed for Roos Foods, SmithKline, and Boiron Homeopathics.

She redesigned the entire website, meeting aggressive deadlines, and established a successful working relationship with CEO. She initiated a project for the redesign of an acquired company, Alvest. Traveling to NYC, she managed, directed and implemented the site architecture and design, working with a 9-person team of web developers and product managers.
Created different prototypes for different products throughout the site, improved design and introduced better user experience.
Increased knowledge of programming code and quality assurance systems to quickly work effectively with all groups involved.

                            <p className="content-text-18">In early 2002, a UX informational site called Web First Aid was created for website design, which included studies done at Stanford University and the Neilson Norman Group, two credible resources in usability, backed with data to support their research.</p>
                            <p className="content-text-18">This site along with the Surreal Concepts website led to a contract with a Pfizer agency to design and organize the largest HCP site at the time. They realized that the same principles of design for small companies were scalable to enterprise levels. Consulting with Pfizer was an opportunity to show that simplicity and efficient communication with strong teamwork helped save Pfizer a half a million dollars

Michael has innate knowledge of not only customers, but businesses. It was noticed that the application being used by the developers was extremely buggy. It causes an unacceptable amount of lost man hours, full story here. Issues were documented and saved Pfizer a lot of money.<p/>
                                <p className="content-text-18">This is one of the many stories that has describes how Surreal Concepts evolved into what WDS is today. The changes and evolution of our services is due to our clients needs.</p>
                                <p className="content-text-18">This was prevalent when tackling design problems and issues with content management systems that didn’t work. Complaints and documentation by Michael  on lost man-hours helped Pfizer to understand the issue and take appropriate action. They replaced the vender, saving and recouping a half a million dollars. Michael has always had an innate sense of business which he applies to his research. Solving business communication issues can solve many of the design issues.</p>

Her perspective is greatly influenced by her hearing loss as a child. Since her outer life became quiet, observations and interpretations were always unique and different.
                            Terri is the heart of WDS, her design sense from fine and graphic art training, humor and design talents has guided and evolved unique design solutions. Her intuitive design skills come from 25+ years of experience in traditional and modern art. Serving as a creative advisory to Michael has enabled both to stay ahead of the design trends and competition. There’s always a way, she says, to make every business unique.
                            Her personal work has intertwined with her professional work as a designer. Creating designs for businesses requires research, empathy and most of all, consistency in their branding. It gave her creativity a powerful purpose.
                            Evolving into a disciplined UX designer created amazing opportunities as a unique visual communicator. 
                            Her greatest joy is when there is a balance of creative flow along with the discipline of design that creates simplicity and inspiration.
