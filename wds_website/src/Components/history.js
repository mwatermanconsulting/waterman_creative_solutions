                        The first time they worked on the Amiga 500, Michael and Terri were fascinated with digital design. With the knowledge and skills that they acquired with the digital video software NewTek Video Toaster, they started a business that focused on video production services. One day a client approached them about an Illustrator project for the Franklin Mint, to digitally reproduce portraits of sports figures. They became experts in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, which sparked their entrepreneurial spirit and Surreal Concepts was born.</p>

They developed a partnership with a flexographic label company, Apogee Industries, designing and preparing documents for the printing press. They also introduced a printing strategy implementing a schedule that supported the client's needs and eliminating missed deadlines. Clients supported at Apogee included SmithKline and Boiron Homeopathy. </p>

                            <p className="content-text-18">Surreal Concepts' design solutions were successful. But they starting asking themselves, "What do the people that are interacting with the websites think?" <br></br>"Are our web designs resonating with users?" <br></br>They set out to research how people interacted with websites by asking questions:<br></br> What were their needs and expectations? <br></br>How did people interact with a web page compared to traditional printed materials? <br></br>In 2003, a study was released by B.J. Fogg and his team at Stanford University revealing the first study on human interaction on websites. The study consisted of user observations of eye movements, click behavior and user interactions. This study changed not not only how they designed, but their entire focus. </p>
                        

                            <p className="content-text-18">In early 2005, Surreal Concepts released a website called WebFirstAid, based on research done by Stanford University, providing a friendly version of the high level educational information contained in the Stanford study. Writing in a user friendly style with bright colors, the goal was to enlighten and inspire businesses about the value of UX through the eyes of the user. Michael repurposed all the information for a series of talks on UX and Design. </p>

                            The project, Pfizer Pro, was the largest HCP website at the time. Michael was contracted for the UX Design,  content strategies, front-end development and bi-weekly updates. During the engagement, Michael's business understanding helped Pfizer by documenting a business problem they had with a vendor. The current CMS program and support was costing Pfizer thousands of dollars a week on lost man hours. This documentation gave Pfizer the knowledge they needed to change vendors and recoup their money.  </p>

                            Surreal Concepts started to make a name for itself for its design and business solutions. After the Pfizer contract was completed Surreal was contracted by Motorola.  Motorola had a large problem that they could not solve with their modem product line. For years the return rate on their line of modems was rising and call center costs were out of control. After two failed attempts to fix this, Surreal Concepts was contracted for UX design, UI design and development to provide business solutions. This was a complex product user interface and tested the scalability of its UX methodology.

                             After 22 years of business Terri and Michael evolved to the point of outgrowing Surreal Concepts. After 4 years away from the business, Michael knew it was time to share his knowledge, strategies and methodologies he gained over the years. Surreal Concepts no longer fit with the new services or todays market. Business needs have changed over the years and competition in the digital space is at an all time high. Businesses today need design support and education on the value of design. Their new services include design, business strategies, talks and workshops. Michael has navigated successfully to enterprise businesses, and under the new name Waterman Design Solutions, the team looks forward to changing the design perspective for all sized businesses. </p>

                        </div> Michael was raised in a creative family and spent his childhood creating, designing and drawing. As Michael matured he began a career in retail. His friendly and caring nature made him a natural at customer service and he quickly climbed the corporate ladder becoming a regional manager in his early twenties. </p>

                            <p className="content-text-18">
                            Life changed after he married Terri. She thought Michael’s talents were being wasted in retail and being an artist herself she inspired him to revisit his creativity.</p>

                            <p className="content-text-18">
                            In the early nineties, Michael left retail and took a year off to learn computers and digital design and video editing. He gained skills in Photoshop v. 3.5, Illustrator and video editing. Michael, having the entrepreneurial spirit, wanted to start his own design company. Along with Terri they choose a name that was very fitting for them at the time, Surreal Concepts. The name was chosen to portray the message that our designs are different and will help you stand out. </p>

                            <p className="content-text-18"> Michael then created a series of "penny saver" mailer coupons, creating fictitious names, logos and designs for a dozen coupons to develop a portfolio. His first interview he got a job as a subcontractor under the Surreal Concepts name. This was the start of his design career.
                            </p>

                            <p className="content-text-18">As soon as the internet boom occurred, Michael learned how to code in HTML, CSS and Flash and Surreal Concepts shifted its focus to website design. One day while looking at a client site they recently designed a thought occurred to him, "Do people enjoy the client websites we designed? Are they having a enjoyable experience?" He began researching about user expectations and the ideal website experience. He took his research and new found knowledge and designed, wrote and developed a website call WebFirstAid.</p> 

                            <p className="content-text-18">WebFirstAid was an information site written for the average user. The goal for the site was to composed and design the site for the average user. They developed webfirstaid website before UX was a thing. The only other proponent of the user experience was Nielson Norman Group, who’s idea of a website back then was just text on a white background. The creation of web first aid opened new opportunities for Surreal Concepts that lead to a contract with Pfizer. </p>

                            <p className="content-text-18">The Pfizer name gave Michael and Surreal Concepts the credibility needed to land the other big names such as <a href="/case_studies_1">Motorola</a> and <a href="/case_studies_1">StubHub</a>. In 2014 Michael left the company to pursue a full time position with OsiSoft as the lead UX/UI designer. </p>

                            <p className="content-text-18">Michael's entrepreneurial spirit got the best of him and he left in  2018 to rebrand Surreal Concepts to Waterman Design Solutions, applying  his experiences to help, guide and support businesses with their design needs. He brings his successful design strategies and UX methodology to reach all businesses. Michael has witnessed the design needs in large companies, and has developed strategies that are beneficial and necessary for success. Michael believes that now is the best time for the new business because empathic design are more critical to business survival than ever before. <br></br>Michael has a vision and renewed passion that will make WDS the design leader. </p>

                            Terri's perspective is greatly influenced by her hearing loss as a child. When the outer life becomes quiet, observations and interpretations will always be unique. She learned that following the crowd was never a good idea to foster creativity. Fine art talent has taught her the importance of staying true to herself, and she continually finds new ways of expressing herself, whether it be through graphic design, advertising, branding, abstract paintings or multimedia art. <br></br>A deep thinker, she has always been curious about how humans behave and respond to life, and how design was about simplifying things to make our lives better. Like the cartooning on this site, the goal was to visibly communicate to you how much WDS values good old fashioned customer service, something that was very prevalent in the 1950s. </p>
                        <br></br>
                        <p className="content-text-18">
                            Her experience working with Michael and their clients has taught her that design has a purpose - empathy, and users ALWAYS embrace designs that take them into consideration. </p>
                        <p className="subtitle">
                            Terri's passion for helping others with her talent is what motivates her to be passionate about her clients' goals.
                            </p>

                           <p className="content-text-18 margin-top-25">As the heart of WDS, Terri's intuitive design skills come from 25+ years    of experience in traditional and modern art. This combination of skills has served her well in all her artistic       endeavors. 
                            
                                Serving as a creative advisory to Michael has enabled her to stay ahead of the design trends and competition. There’s ABSOLUTELY a way, she says, to make every business unique. 
                                Her personal work has intertwined with her professional work as a designer by evolving into a disciplined UX designer, which led to amazing opportunities as a unique visual communicator. 
                                Her greatest joy is when there is a balance of creative flow along with the discipline of design that creates simplicity and inspiration. </p>
