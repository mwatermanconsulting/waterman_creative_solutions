                        <b>Background - </b>
                        OsiSoft is a data historian company that sells databases and software that provide data insights, called the PI system. Osi was attempting to transition from traditional desktop software to software as a service (SaaS) for their premiere data visualization platform. OsiSoft hired WDS to help with the SaaS transition, and to provide design guidance, <a href ="case_studies.js" className="greenlink content-text-21"> css development</a> and UX design support.
                    </p>
                    <p className="content-text-18 content-block-65 margin-top-15" >
                        <b>Issue Uncovered -</b>
                        WDS began their methodology by developing a user journey, followed by a design analysis of their SaaS offering. The user journey uncovered two steps the user needed to complete before accessing the data visualization application. These steps involved database settings and user authentication on two separate applications. WDS conducted design analysis between the three applications. The design analysis revealed major inconsistencies between the visual elements of the applications. They were curious about how this design problem occurred. Engineers, designers, UX team and team leads were interviewed to bring clarity to the problems. WDS uncovered a lack of communication between the teams and team leads. Design requirements were missing on each of the projects. The company was missing basic design direction and guidance, leading to design inconsistencies.</p> 

                    <p className="content-text-18 content-block-65 margin-top-15" >   
                        The real problem  was the lack of communication between the teams. Each team was working on an island and didn't  realize there were design issues. WDS presented the findings to the stakeholders, sharing screenshots of the three applications in comparison to one another. This was the first time they witnessed a visual design analysis, causing one the stakeholders to state, "I think we have a problem." The stakeholders admitted this has been a problem for years, but could never solve the problem.  
                    </p>

                    <p className="content-text-18 content-block-65 margin-top-15">
                        <b>Strategy - </b>
                        WDS knew that the largest problem needed to be solved first - the communication issues. WDS proposed a unique solution, the creation of a design support system - the UX Steering Team. WDS would lead the team and would implement a communication strategy to spread the value of design within the company. The goal of this team was to guide and develop design standards and to communicate the value of design to the teams. The UX Steering Team would have monthly meetings occurring the week before a scrum cycle. The meetings would focus on communicating design and coding strategies while providing guidance and support. The team also solved the issue of feature duplication among the teams. 
                    </p>

                    <p className="content-block-65 content-text-18 margin-top-15" ><b>Results - </b>
                        The UX Steering team provided a unique strategy for a common problem. The team helped bridged the gap between designers, developers and the UX team by eliminating communication issues and providing a forum to talk about design within the company. The strategy also provided a long term road-map for the team, starting with product consistency and component sharing amongst the teams. WDS championed design consistency and led the movement for it by first developing a CSS Solutions and strategy for the company. The strategy included shared global CSS classes and a custom UI design kit. WDS also developed workshops for CSS, Sass and responsive design and development. Later WDS designed and developed Style Guides and Design Systems for OsiSoft to support the long time strategy and vision of of UX Steering team of application consistency. After 5 years the UX team still meets, providing design support and guidance for the company.

                        WDS design workshops are built with empathy for engineers and developers. It is a common business practice to place the design burden on engineers and developers. The results are unprofessional designs that are never tested. This is the "good enough syndrome."  Features and time constraints factor in more than design and testing, resulting in a failed product offering. WDS strategies and workshops teach  teams how to incorporate design requirements during sprint cycles. </p>

                        Design solutions are no longer an invisible, unknown entity. WDS has seen the results of its designs over the years because they care about results. By implementing telemetry, design results can be tracked and measured. WDS has analytics experts that can provide monthly reports and business design strategies based on real data.

                        Telemetry data is extremely valuable to understanding users' pain points. A well defined telemetry strategy will track user workflows, alerting the UX team to user dropouts and unusual behavior. Analytics can also provide insights on unused features, reducing software bloat.

                        The Web is fundamentally designed to work for all people, whatever their hardware, software, language, location, or ability. When the Web meets this goal, it is accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability.</p>

However, when websites, applications, technologies, or tools are badly designed, they can create barriers that exclude people.</p>
