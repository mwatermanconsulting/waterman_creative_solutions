                            <b>Background - </b>
                            OsiSoft is a data historian company that sells databases and software that provide data insights, called the PI system. Osi was attempting to transition from traditional desktop software to software as a service (SaaS) for their premiere data visualization platform. OsiSoft hired WDS to help with the SaaS transition, and to provide design guidance, <a href ="case_studies.js"> css development</a> and UX design support.
                        </p>
                        <p className="content-text-21 content-block-65 margin-top-15" >
                            <b>Issue Uncovered -</b>
                            WDS began their methodology by creating a user journey, followed by a design analysis of the SaaS offering. The user journey uncovered two steps the user needed to complete before accessing the data visualization application. These steps involved database and user authentication settings on two separate applications. The next step was a design analysis between the three applications. The design analysis revealed major inconsistencies between the visual elements of the applications. WDS was curious of how this issue occurred interviewing engineers, designers, UX team and team leads for the project. Their findings indicated a lack of communication between the teams and team leads. Design requirements were missing, meaning there was no design direction in the company, which lead to the inconsistency problems. The real problem though was the lack of communication between the teams. They were working on an island and didn't even realize the issue. WDS presented the findings to the shareholders, sharing screenshots of the three applications. This was the first time they witnessed a visual design analysis, causing one the stakeholders to state, "I think we have a problem." The shareholders admitted this has been a problem for years, but could never solve the problem.

                        <p className="content-block-65 content-text-21 margin-top-15" style={{width:'85%'}}>
                            <b>Strategy - </b>
                            WDS knew that the largest problem needed to be solved first, the communication issues. WDS proposed a unique solution the creation of a UX Steering team. WDS was attempting to solve the largest issue by implementing a strategy to creating a design support team within the company. The goal of this team was to set a list of design standards and communicate them to the teams. The team would have monthly meetings occurring the week before a scrum cycle. The monthly meetings would be focused on communicating design, coding strategies, providing guidance and support. Another issue that was found was feature duplication among the teams, lost man hours by teams developing features that were already developed. The strategy was having these teams meet and discuss their projects would eliminate the duplication by sharing these features among the teams. 
                        </p>

                        <p className="content-block-65 content-text-21 margin-top-15" style={{width:'85%'}}><b>Results - </b>
                            The UX Steering was a unique strategy for a common problem. It helped bridged the gap between designers, developers and the UX team with communication issues and provided a forum to talk about design within the company. The strategy roadmap for the team started with product consistency and component sharing amongst the teams. WDS led the movement for consistency by developing CSS Solutions for the company that included shared global CSS classes, along with a custom UI kit. WDS also developed workshops for CSS, SASS and responsive development. WDS moved on to create and develop the company Style Guides and Design System to support the long time strategy and vision of UX Steering team of application consistency. After 5 years the UX team still meets, providing design support and guidance for the company.

                        Design solutions are no longer an invisible, unknown entity. WDS has seen the results of our designs over the years, because they care about results. By implementing telemetry, design results can be tracked and measured. WDS has analytics experts that can provide monthly reports and business design strategies based on real data.

                        Telemetry data is extremely valuable to understanding users' pain points. A well defined telemetry strategy will track user workflows, alerting the UX team to user dropouts and unusual behavior. The analytics can also provide data on unused features, reducing software bloat.

                        The Web is fundamentally designed to work for all people, whatever their hardware, software, language, location, or ability. When the Web meets this goal, it is accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability.</p>
                    
                        <p className="content-text-18"> The impact of disability has radically changed on the Web because barriers are removed that prevent communication and interaction that many people face in the physical world. However, when web sites, applications, technologies, or tools are badly designed, they can create barriers that exclude people from using the Web.</p>
