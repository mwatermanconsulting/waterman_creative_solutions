                         At the foundation of WDS methodology is observation—watching consumers use products or services. But unlike in focus groups, usability laboratories, and other contexts of traditional market research, such observation is conducted in the customer’s own environment—in the course of normal, everyday routines. In such a context, researchers can gain access to a host of information that is not accessible through other observation-oriented research methods.

                                Sometimes, customers are so accustomed to current conditions that they don’t think to ask for a new solution, even if they have real needs that could be addressed. Habit tends to drag us to behave inconveniently; as consumers we create “work-arounds” that become familiar and we may forget that we are being forced to behave in a less-than-optimal fashion. This can make us incapable of telling UX designers what we really want. </p>

                                For example, when asked about an editing function in a software package, one customer had no complaints until she sat down to use the program in front of the observer. Then she realized that her work was disrupted when the program did not automatically wrap text around graphics while she edited. Accustomed to working around the problem, she had not mentioned it in earlier interviews. When the observer notices this and points it out, it opens up an important issue that should be dealt with to make her life easier. All the little things add up as big time wasters that need to be eliminated.

But empathy has always been at the heart of our services in User Experience and Customer Service. We are trained to use empathy in our work: <br></br>“Walk in the user’s shoes.” <br></br>“See the problem as if you were experiencing it yourself."<br></br>“Observe their daily routines.” <br></br>All of these mantras and behaviors are empathetic techniques that UX designers have honed by creating amazing, innovative products and services.

                                A set of techniques we call empathetic design can help resolve those uncovered in the research phase. At its foundation is observation — watching consumers use products or services. But unlike focus groups, usability laboratories, and other contexts of traditional market research, our observations are conducted in the customer’s own environment. In such a context, researchers can gain access to a host of information that is not accessible through other observation-oriented research methods.

Knowing how the unconscious brain makes decisions reveals solutions on a deep level. </p>
