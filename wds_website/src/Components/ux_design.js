                        The most meaningful insights for design strategy are developed with a behavior-based understanding of users. WDS UX strategists observe people in context - where they work, play or live - to understand their goals, their needs and aspirations as they go about their daily lives. If a product does not yet exist, this firsthand look helps to identify unmet needs that a product may solve. </div>

                                Sometimes customers are so accustomed to current conditions that they don’t think to ask for a new solution, even if they have real needs that could be addressed. As consumers, we create workarounds that become a habit and we may forget that we are being forced to behave that way,
                            in a less-than-optimal fashion. This can make us incapable of telling UX designers what we really want. </p>

                                For example, when asked about an editing function in a software package, one customer had no complaints until she sat down to use the program in front of the observer. Then she realized that her work was disrupted when the program did not automatically wrap text around graphics while she edited. Accustomed to working around the problem, she had not mentioned it in earlier interviews. When the observer notices this and points it out, it opens up an important issue that needs to be dealt with to make her life easier. </p>

                                Empathy is a very powerful selling tool, because it is human-centric.

                                Understanding people as they go about completing a task is essential to guarantee a positive user experience. Every action of that task is an experience with your product or service. The experience can be positive or negative, depending on how much of the user was taken into account when designing.

                                The user experience takes many shapes and forms: retail, product development, websites and applications. The user has a goal to achieve and it's up to you to make it enjoyable and simple. It is critical to your success to have a UX designer that empathizes with people and understands cognitive psychology. The the unconscious mind reveals solutions on a deeper level.
