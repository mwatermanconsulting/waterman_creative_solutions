                         At the foundation of WDS methodology is observation—watching consumers use products or services. But unlike in focus groups, usability laboratories, and other contexts of traditional market research, such observation is conducted in the customer’s own environment—in the course of normal, everyday routines. In such a context, researchers can gain access to a host of information that is not accessible through other observation-oriented research methods.

                                Sometimes, customers are so accustomed to current conditions that they don’t think to ask for a new solution—even if they have real needs that could be addressed. Habit tends to inure us to inconvenience; as consumers, we create “work-arounds” that become so familiar we may forget that we are being forced to behave in a less-than-optimal fashion—and thus we may be incapable of telling UX designers what we really want. </p>

                                For example, when asked about an editing function in a software package, one customer had no complaints—until she sat down to use the program in front of the observer. Then she realized that her work was disrupted when the program did not automatically wrap text around graphics while she edited. Accustomed to working around the problem, she had not mentioned it in earlier interviews.

                                <p className="content-text-18"> 
                                Empathy is a very powerful selling tool. These days, it’s the new buzz word used by companies. But empathy has always been at the heart of User Experience and Customer Service. We are trained to use empathy in our work: “Walk in the user’s shoes.” “See the problem as if you were experiencing it yourself.“Observe their daily routines.” All of these mantras and behaviors are empathetic techniques that UX designers have honed by creating amazing, innovative products and services. In reality this is old school custom service. </p>

                            <p className="content-text-18">
                                A set of techniques we call empathic design can help resolve those uncovered in the research phase. At its foundation is observation—watching consumers use products or services. But unlike in focus groups, usability laboratories, and other contexts of traditional market research, such observation is conducted in the customer’s own environment—in the course of normal, everyday routines. In such a context, researchers can gain access to a host of information that is not accessible through other observation-oriented research methods.</p>

                            Understanding and empathizing with them as they go about completing a task. Every action of that task provides an experience for the customer, sometimes unconscious  for the UX is all about user experience. The experience they have with your product service. The experience can be positive or negative depending how much of the user went into the design of the product, system and user interface. User expectations have changed over the years. Simplicity is expected. Just look at the changes that have happened in the last decade with Retail.  Amazon, simplified the shopping experience down to one click.  </p>

                            The user experience takes many shapes and forms. From retail, products, websites, to applications. The user has a goal to achieve and it's up to you to make it enjoyable. Its critical to your customer success to have a company that not only understand and empathizes with people, but understands cognitive psychology. Knowing how the unconscious brain makes decisions, reveals solutions on a deep level. </p>
