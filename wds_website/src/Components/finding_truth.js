                        At the beginning of the methodology, WDS sets the foundation for success by developing an
                        understanding of the business, the industry, the competition and relevant trends. This is the basis for how subsequent phases are approached, which includes secondary research, interviewing stakeholders and subject matter experts in order to gain a first-hand awareness of the company context and build connections within the business. This contributes to stakeholder alignment throughout the engagement and begins to define a hypothesis for where the company intends to play in the market, who it intends to serve and how it plans to serve them.

Personas keep the focus on real people who exhibit unique sets of characteristics, which  assists the team throughout ideation, design and marketing to help them develop appropriate solutions and messages.</p>
                            <p className="content-text-18">While personas are a popular technique used by many companies, especially to argue use cases,  WDS personas are far more robust than those created from market research data alone. It is developed by well-crafted personas grounded in user observations based on REAL users instead of simple demographic data. </p>

                            When an engagement centers on a complex tool for enterprise business, the simplified workflow diagram captures activity across organizational roles and provides stakeholders a single view of all of the work accomplished in and around a tool.

                            Through the use of a simplified workflow diagram, how a user moves through tasks is revealed and extrapolated from here to the various cognitive states a user inhabits while engaged with the solution or process.
                            These cognitive states represent a model of what is in people’s minds as they do their work, their mental model. This understanding has implications for both design and marketing.</p>

                            The cognitive states can help to inform the interface  a new way to navigate and complete tasks in a software tool. By aligning with how people think about their work, WDS produces tools that are intuitive and easy to use. This understanding also provides input to marketing by providing key information for creating a communication plan that resonates with customers. </p>

                            The framework is a set of principles or questions that guide the development of ideas for solutions as well as the subsequent work performed by multiple teams in developing and marketing those solutions: architects, marketers, designers, branders, etc. This decision-making framework is valuable because it puts to work the understanding of the needs and concerns of the customer group, captured in the field observations.
