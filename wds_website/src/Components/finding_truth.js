                          understanding of the business, the industry, the competition and relevant trends. This becomes the basis for how we approach all subsequent phases. Along with secondary research, we interview stakeholders and subject matter experts, both to gain a first-hand awareness of the company context, and also to build connections within the business which contribute to stakeholder alignment throughout the engagement. This activity begins to define hypotheses for where the company intends to play in the market, who it intends to serve and how it plans to serve them.

                            These cognitive states represent a model of what is in people’s minds as they do their work: their mental model. This understanding has implications for both design and marketing.</p>

                            The framework is a set of principles or questions that guide the development of ideas for solutions as well as the subsequent work performed by multiple teams in developing and marketing those solutions: architects, marketers, designers, branders, etc. This decision-making framework is valuable because it puts to work the understanding of the needs and concerns of the customer group, captured in the field observations.
