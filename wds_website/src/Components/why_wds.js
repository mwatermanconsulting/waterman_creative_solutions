            The best customer experience starts with the Golden Rule — Treat customers how you would like to be treated. At the foundation of WDS methodology is observation—watching consumers use products or services. But unlike in focus groups, usability laboratories, and other contexts of traditional market research, such observation is conducted in the customer’s own environment—in the course of normal, everyday routines. In such a context, researchers can gain access to a host of information that is not accessible through other observation-oriented research methods. </p>

                                WDS has the honour of being the third option on quite a few projects, including the stubhub project. Many times the previous experiences were unsuccessful not meeting business or users needs. It's not easy to follow unsuccessful design projects. Developers and stakeholders are on edge, but our team empathizes with the situation. Once we begin our methodology and advocating for the users we begin connecting with the developers and stakeholders, amazing things begin happen.</p>
