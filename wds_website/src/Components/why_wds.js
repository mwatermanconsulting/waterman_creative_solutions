                                WDS has the honour of being the third option on quite a few projects, including the stubhub project. Many times the previous experiences were unsuccessful not meeting business or users needs. It's not easy to follow unsuccessful design projects. Developers and stakeholders are on edge, but our team empathizes with the situation. Once we begin our methodology and advocating for the users we begin connecting with the developers and stakeholders, amazing things begin happen.</p>
