                        WDS understands the fear many companies have with contracting a design firm.

These designers fail and frustrate companies, making them  apprehensive about contracting another UX design firm. WDS approaches every project with empathy for the user and business. They have fixed unsuccessful designs for large enterprise projects like Motorola and StubHub, turning failure into success and frustration into joy.</p>

                        The best customer experience starts with the Golden Rule — treat customers how you would like to be treated. At the foundation of WDS methodology is observation, watching customers use the clients' products or services. But unlike focus groups or usability laboratories, WDS conducts observation and interviews in the customer’s own environment during the course of their everyday routines. In such a context  researchers gain insight to a host of information that is not accessible through other UX research methods. </p>

                     A design system is a continuously evolving single source of truth that establishes rules of visual narration and interaction. It must be comprehensive while combining components, behaviors, and branding. It also comes with a complete set of design standards, documentation, and strategies. It must also be flexible and scalable.
